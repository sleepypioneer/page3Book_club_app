        <h2>*** FEBRUARY BOOK POLL***</h2>
        <p> Hello Readers!<br><br>
            I hope January has given you enough cold evenings to curl up and finish 'Do Not Say We Have Nothing'. It's a chunker and I'm certainly not finished. <br>
            Below are the book choices for February. I just want to flag that Baise Moi includes some explicit and violent rape scenes. If anyone who wants to read this month is uncomfortable reading and then as a group discussing that, then please send me or Rachel a message, and no questions asked we will replace it with another choice. <br>
            We think sensitive topics are important to address and discuss but would rather everyone felt welcome and comfortable...there are enough other books on our list!
        </p>
